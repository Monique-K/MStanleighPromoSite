        <h3>‘ABOUT ME’</h3>
        <br />
        <p><b>A personal description/screenplay by Mark Stanleigh</b></p>
        <br />
        <div className="left">
          <p><b>INT. MESSY HOME OFFICE </b>- Possibly Day (There’s no way to tell for certain) </p>
          <br />
          <p>The bright bluish glow of a monitor illuminates a storyboard artist hunched over his computer in the dark. He is thirtyish, unbelievably handsome and intelligent, but also disheveled with a scraggly beard, baggy sweatpants and a horrible hunched-over posture. It’s clear from the piles of papers and rubbish around him that he hasn’t moved or slept in days...maybe even weeks. This is MARK STANLEIGH.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The dark bags around his eyes bunch up and as he strains to remember all the great work experiences he’s had over the years and maintain focus on the screen. His eyes are desperate to rest, but his mind knows that he must finish explaining his previous jobs on two animated feature films. </p>
          <br />
          <p>On the computer monitor- we can see him typing… “I’m a story artist and writer who is extremely passionate about the process and love collaborating with other creative passionate people!”  </p>
          <br />
          <p>It’s all lies. As he types, we hear his wife COLETTE call out to him. </p>
          <br />

        <h3>COLETTE O/S</h3>
        <br />
        <p>MAAAARRKKK!!! </p>

        <div className="left"><p>He jumps back, startled. </p></div>
        <br />
        <h3>MARK</h3>
        <p className="lines">WHAAT?! I’M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF WRITING MY PERSONAL DESCRIPTION SLASH SCREENPLAY, HUN! </p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>Colette enters the room and smiles at him. </p></div>
        <br />

        <h3>COLETTE</h3>
        <p className="lines">Sorry to bug you, I just wanted to make sure you remembered to include the information about how you’ve also directed several live-action music videos. Especially mention the DJ Shub one,‘Indomitable’ since it was nominated for a Much Music Video Award! It’s a big deal! </p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>Mark groans in uncertainty.</p></div>
        <br />

        <h3>MARK</h3>
        <p className="lines">I don’t know... won’t that come off kind of braggy? </p>
        <br />



        <h3>COLETTE </h3>
        <p className="lines">Oh not at all! If anything, it will make you look well-rounded and show them that you pursue other creatives avenues. You’re constantly trying to learn and improve your storytelling abilities and I think they should know! </p>
        <br />

        <h3>MARK</h3>
        <p className="lines">I guess... I still feel weird about it, but I’m gonna trust you on this one. I love you!</p>

        <h3>COLETTE</h3>
        <p className="lines">I love you too, hun. </p>
        <br />

        <p>Colette leans down and gives Mark a kiss. He smiles up at her and she smiles back lovingly. </p>

        <h3>COLETTE CONT.</h3>
        <p className="lines">Oh and hun….</p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>She leans in and gently holds his face. </p></div>

        <h3>MARK</h3>
        <p className="lines">Yeah? </p>
        <br />

        <h3>COLETTE</h3>
        <p className="lines">Clean up your shit. Seriously. This is disgusting. </p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>She kicks a bunch of empty coffee cups and walks out. </p></div>
        <br />

        <h3>MARK</h3>
        <p className="lines">It’s not that bad! …. I’m busy! Ugh...</p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>He gets up and starts picking up coffee cups off the floor, but his phone vibrates across the desk. He grabs it and answers in a huff. </p></div>

        <h3>MARK</h3> (on phone)
        <p className="lines">This isn’t really a good time, Mom…</p>
        <br />

        <h3>MOM</h3> (over phone) 
        <p className="lines">Hi Marky! I was just thinking about you and wanted to make sure you didn’t forget to mention all your amazing work experience! </p>
        <br />

        <div className="left"><p>Mark sighs. </p></div>
