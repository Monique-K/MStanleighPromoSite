# Storyboard Artist Promo Site
Mark Stanleigh is a storyboard artist. This is his website. It's an online portfolio featuring snippets of his work. Its cool design and smooth functionality makes you want to hire him to do your storyboards and me to make your website.

## Slideshows
Check out scenes from past and upcoming work. Click on the scene name to watch the storyboards come alive before your eyes!

And do the scenes autoplay? You bet they do! No clicking "Next" for you! Just sit back and enjoy.

## Rotating Homescreen Images
Tired of seeing the same image every time you log onto a site? Not here! Every time you log on, a background image is randomly selected for you.
